# Data Science Portfolio by Chi-Hao Sheng
A collection of projects ranging from data collection to model deployment that utilized various machine learning and deep learning techniques. 

# End-to-End Projects
Projects that combined my interests with data science concepts. The entirety of the projects involved data collection, data analysis, model training, and model deployment.

[**Battlefield V Analysis and Prediction**](https://github.com/chihaos1/Battlefield-V-Analysis-and-Prediction) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Final Website Link](https://battlefieldv-stats-prediction.herokuapp.com/)\
Analyzed players' statistics to evaluate players' performance by predicting their Score Per Minute (SPM).
* Scrapped over 18,000 player statistics from [Battlefield Tracker](https://battlefieldtracker.com/) using Python and Scrapy. 
* Used data wrangling techniques to clean the collected data.
* Created a linear regression model (MAE ~ 40 SPM) to predict player's Score Per Minute.
* Built a web API using Flask with data visualization graphed by Chart.js.
* Deployed the model on the web API using Heroku.
